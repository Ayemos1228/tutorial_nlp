stephen rea , aidan quinn , and alan bates play desmond's legal eagles , and when joined by brosnan , the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty irish settings is a pleasant enough thing , 'tis . 
dreary tale of middle-class angst
who needs mind-bending drugs when they can see this , the final part of the 'qatsi' trilogy , directed by godfrey reggio , with music by philip glass ? 
byler reveals his characters in a way that intrigues and even fascinates us , and he never reduces the situation to simple melodrama . 
no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . 
the film's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place . 
morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but morvern callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start . 
bartlett's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made . 
a movie just for friday fans , critics be damned . if you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again . 
with the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which they isn't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright . 
the movie is pretty funny now and then without in any way demeaning its subjects . 
so boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it . 
a film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations . 
kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for ( or worth rooting against , for that matter ) . 
a wildly entertaining scan of evans' career . 
despite auteuil's performance , it's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug . 
i didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube , and his skinny buddy mike epps , to make like laurel and hardy 'n the hood . 
neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored . 
sly , sophisticated and surprising . 
a drama of great power , yet some members of the audience will leave the theater believing they have seen a comedy . 
comes off like a bad imitation of the bard . 
ambitious , unsettling psychodrama that takes full , chilling advantage of its rough-around-the-edges , low-budget constraints . 
a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity . 
sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy . . . attal looks so much like a young robert deniro that it seems the film should instead be called 'my husband is travis bickle' . 
confirms the nagging suspicion that ethan hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it . 
the result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone . 
it never fails to engage us . 
it's all surface psychodramatics . 
a highly personal look at the effects of living a dysfunctionally privileged lifestyle , and by the end , we only wish we could have spent more time in its world . 
a delicious and delicately funny look at the residents of a copenhagen neighborhood coping with the befuddling complications life tosses at them . 
the whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well . 
katz's documentary doesn't have much panache , but with material this rich it doesn't need it . 
if this is cinema , i pledge allegiance to cagney and lacey . 
only two words will tell you what you know when deciding to see it : anthony . hopkins . 
the wonder of mostly martha is the performance of gedeck , who makes martha enormously endearing . 
the faithful will enjoy this sometimes wry adaptation of v . s . naipaul's novel , but newcomers may find themselves stifling a yawn or two during the first hour . 
the bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted needn't waste their time on it . 
there's plenty to impress about e . t . 
as i settled into my world war ii memories , i found myself strangely moved by even the corniest and most hackneyed contrivances . 
starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion . 
the tuxedo wasn't just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , 'hungry-man portions of bad' . 
the history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling . they just don't work in concert . 
the film presents visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet . 
heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations . 
it's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part . 
an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength . 
the movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness . 
a fascinating , dark thriller that keeps you hooked on the delicious pulpiness of its lurid fiction . 
unlike lots of hollywood fluff , this has layered , well-developed characters and some surprises . 
presents an astute appraisal of middle american musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it . 
makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases . 
a generous , inspiring film that unfolds with grace and humor and gradually becomes a testament to faith . 
the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) . 
halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles . it's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy . 
an affectionately goofy satire that's unafraid to throw elbows when necessary . . . 
the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama . 
it jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding mtier . 
a clever script and skilled actors bring new energy to the familiar topic of office politics . 
flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as morvern's thick , working-class scottish accent . 
a stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for kissinger as a calculating war criminal . 
an exhilarating experience . 
the film's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise . 
an oddity , to be sure , but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion . 
an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound . 
like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but didn't know how to handle it . 
director charles stone iii applies more detail to the film's music than to the story line ; what's best about drumline is its energy . 
daring , mesmerizing and exceedingly hard to forget . 
part of the film's cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz . 
lazy , miserable and smug . this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year . 
13 conversations may be a bit too enigmatic and overly ambitious to be fully successful , but sprecher and her screenwriting partner and sister , karen sprecher , don't seem ever to run out of ideas . 
there are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they're not exactly flattering . 
a moving and not infrequently breathtaking film . 
'you'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . you'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter . . . '
one groan-inducing familiarity begets another . 
we started to wonder if  some unpaid intern had just typed 'chris rock , ' 'anthony hopkins' and 'terrorists' into some univac-like script machine . 
as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot 'surprises' are really surprising . 
highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role . 
too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette . 
while i can't say it's on par with the first one , stuart little 2 is a light , fun cheese puff of a movie . 
as surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph , as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming . 
the cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing . 
it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) . 
one of the most significant moviegoing pleasures of the year . 
a delightful little film that revels in its own simplicity , mostly martha will leave you with a smile on your face and a grumble in your stomach . 
full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny
it's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up , a terrific climax , and some nice chills along the way . 
the film , like jimmy's routines , could use a few good laughs . 
for all the dolorous trim , secretary is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers' sporadic dips into pop freudianism . 
a wild comedy that could only spring from the demented mind of the writer of being john malkovich . 
i found myself liking the film , though in this case one man's treasure could prove to be another man's garbage . 
your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make . 
an exhilarating serving of movie fluff . 
while van wilder may not be the worst national lampoon film , it's far from being this generation's animal house . 
uneven but a lot of fun . 
daringly perceptive , taut , piercing and feisty , biggie and tupac is undeniably subversive and involving in its bold presentation . 
one of [herzog's] least inspired works . 
completely awful iranian drama . . . as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque . 
there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production . 
muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , is a canny crowd pleaser , and the last kiss . . . provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex . 
lan yu is a genuine love story , full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery . 
the cast comes through even when the movie doesn't . 
zany , exuberantly irreverent animated space adventure . 
'[the cockettes] provides a window into a subculture hell-bent on expressing itself in every way imaginable . '
no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go . 
exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids . 
a film with contemporary political resonance illustrated by a winning family story . 
this is christmas future for a lot of baby boomers . 
the cast is phenomenal , especially the women . 
we need [moore's] noisy , cocky energy , his passion and class consciousness ; we need his shticks , we need his stones . 
beautifully filmed and well acted . . . but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics . 
a banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy . 
one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea . 
the sundance film festival has become so buzz-obsessed that fans and producers descend upon utah each january to ferret out the next great thing . 'tadpole' was one of the films so declared this year , but it's really more of the next pretty good thing . 
the movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it weren't true . this is the stuff that disney movies are made of . 
it's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director's previous full frontal . 
i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd . 
chamber of secrets will find millions of eager fans . but if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie . 
it's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it's about as exciting as a sunburn . 
otto-sallies has a real filmmaker's eye . 
the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them . 
this is one of the year's best films . 
 " extreme ops " exceeds expectations . good fun , good action , good acting , good dialogue , good pace , good cinematography . 
tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality . 
empire can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film . it doesn't work as either . 
its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered . 
 ( wendigo is ) why we go to the cinema : to be fed through the eye , the heart , the mind . 
one of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced . 
it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving . 
obligada para impotentes , daneses , camareras italianas , profesores de idiomas , y todo aquel que desee una lengua para expresar su amor . 
the movie isn't always easy to look at . but if it is indeed a duty of art to reflect life , than leigh has created a masterful piece of artistry right here . 
rarely have i seen a film so willing to champion the fallibility of the human heart . 
psychologically revealing . 
it's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can . 
 . . . an airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you'll wonder if lopez's publicist should share screenwriting credit . 
it's an ambitious film , and as with all ambitious films , it has some problems . but on the whole , you're gonna like this movie . 
everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable . 
[denis'] bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product . 
movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold' revelation . but in 2002 , such revelations wilt . 
it virtually defines a comedy that's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while . 
nothing denis has made before , like beau travil and nenette et boni , could prepare us for this gory , perverted , sex-soaked riff on the cannibal genre . 
ms . phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either esther's initial anomie or her eventual awakening . 
does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny . 
conforms itself with creating a game of 'who's who' . . . where the characters' moves are often more predictable than their consequences . 
the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid . 
it offers a glimpse of the solomonic decision facing jewish parents in those turbulent times : to save their children and yet to lose them . 
two hours fly by -- opera's a pleasure when you don't have to endure intermissions -- and even a novice to the form comes away exhilarated . 
just offbeat enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over . 
with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man's monster movie . 
it's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role . 
if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title . 
the director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone . 
perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about . 
it is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth . 
presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable . 
the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes . 
it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding
imagine ( if possible ) a pasolini film without passion or politics , or an almodovar movie without beauty or humor , and you have some idea of the glum , numb experience of watching o fantasma . 
the film's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political blair witch , a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen . 
de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal . 
the words , 'frankly , my dear , i don't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate . 
by candidly detailing the politics involved in the creation of an extraordinary piece of music , [jones] calls our attention to the inherent conflict between commerce and creativity . 
even the digressions are funny . 
a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone's crazy french grandfather . 
this is a smart movie that knows its classical music , knows its freud and knows its sade . 
an awkward hybrid of genres that just doesn't work . 
what 'dumb and dumber' would have been without the vulgarity and with an intelligent , life-affirming script . 
the film fits into a genre that has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself , vibrant with originality . 
you cannot guess why the cast and crew didn't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed . 
director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the " miami vice " checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks . he doesn't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash . 
one of the most highly-praised disappointments i've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time . 
it's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch . 
this is not an easy film . but it could be , by its art and heart , a necessary one . 
the trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls . 
none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest . 
the actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus . 
the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes . 
we hate [madonna] within the film's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground . 
a pleasing , often-funny comedy . 
see scratch for the history , see scratch for the music , see scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion . 
life is a crock -- or something like it . 
you should pay nine bucks for this : because you can hear about suffering afghan refugees on the news and still be unaffected . dramas like this make it human . 
a thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwed-up man who dared to mess with some powerful people , seen through the eyes of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause . 
the film starts out as competent but unremarkable . . . and gradually grows into something of considerable power . 
feels strangely hollow at its emotional core . 
finds a way to tell a simple story , perhaps the simplest story of all , in a way that seems compelling and even original . 
doesn't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films . 
these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining . 
it's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys , regardless of their ages . 
thanks to haynes' absolute control of the film's mood , and buoyed by three terrific performances , far from heaven actually pulls off this stylistic juggling act . 
it's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-soviet russia . 
i won't argue with anyone who calls 'slackers' dumb , insulting , or childish . . . but i laughed so much that i didn't mind . 
 . . . ice age treads predictably along familiar territory , making it a passable family film that won't win many fans over the age of 12 . 
ends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick would . 
a conventional but heartwarming tale . 
an overwrought taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship . 
i am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from tv shows , but hey arnold ! the movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance . 
thanks to the chteau's balance of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation , almost every relationship and personality in the film yields surprises . 
a rip-roaring comedy action fest that'll put hairs on your chest . 
femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ? 
leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances . 
gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichs . 
just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be . 
lasker's canny , meditative script distances sex and love , as byron and luther . . . realize they can't get no satisfaction without the latter . 
a bravura exercise in emptiness . 
not exactly the bees knees
a stylish thriller . 
it's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and i think even fans of sandler's comic taste may find it uninteresting . 
ranks among willams' best screen work . 
nothing is sacred in this gut-buster . 
cho's timing is priceless . 
ludicrous , but director carl franklin adds enough flourishes and freak-outs to make it entertaining . 
rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down . 
as self-aware movies go , who is cletis tout ? is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing . 
a startling and fresh examination of how the bike still remains an ambiguous icon in chinese society . 
peppered with witty dialogue and inventive moments . 
 . . . there is enough originality in 'life' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens . 
as giddy and whimsical and relevant today as it was 270 years ago . 
 . . . the implication is kissinger may have decided that  when it comes to truncheoning  it's better to give than to receive . 
eric schweig and graham greene both exude an air of dignity that's perfect for the proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters . 
i have no problem with " difficult " movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out . but first , you have to give the audience a reason to <b>want</b> to put for that effort , and " i
mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline . 
whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . but , no , we get another scene , and then another . you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain . 
 . . . a true delight . 
the film's strength isn't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears . 
costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier . 
 . . . a roller-coaster ride of a movie
charming , if overly complicated . . . 
it's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions . 
grant gets to display his cadness to perfection , but also to show acting range that may surprise some who thought light-hearted comedy was his forte . 
the tasteful little revision works wonders , enhancing the cultural and economic subtext , bringing richer meaning to the story's morals . 
it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its " dead wife communicating from beyond the grave " framework is even remotely new or interesting . 
brisk hack job . 
miller tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise , expertly plucking tension from quiet . 
it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject . 
features what is surely the funniest and most accurate depiction of writer's block ever . 
there is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine . 
apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths . marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess . 
a nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent . 
wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste . 
demonstrates the unusual power of thoughtful , subjective filmmaking . 
'enigma' is the kind of engaging historical drama that hollywood appears to have given up on in favor of sentimental war movies in the vein of 'we were soldiers . '
it's impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure . 
where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines . 
the film is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders , but deftly manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill . 
this is amusing for about three minutes . 
this is not chabrol's best , but even his lesser works outshine the best some directors can offer . 
at the bottom rung of the series' entries . 
the new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities . 
exposing the ways we fool ourselves is one hour photo's real strength . 
stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about . 
a welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic , this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story . 
a smug and convoluted action-comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie . 
not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe , but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions . 
it recycles every clich about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 
we may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again . 
a yarn that respects the marvel version without becoming ensnared by it . 
sodden and glum , even in those moments where it's supposed to feel funny and light . 
a hidden-agenda drama that shouts classic french nuance . 
parris' performance is credible and remarkably mature . 
as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 
i liked about schmidt a lot , but i have a feeling that i would have liked it much more if harry & tonto never existed . 
not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches . 
it's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time . 
self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable . 
with a confrontational stance , todd solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families . 
claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem . 
this toothless dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen . 
the only camouflage carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers . 
there are problems with this film that even 3 oscar winners can't overcome , but it's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling . 
not as distinctive or even as humorous as its needs to be to stand out , but it has clearly been made with affection and care . 
griffin & co . manage to be spectacularly outrageous . 
i'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about . 
asia authors herself as anna battista , an italian superstar and aspiring directress who just happens to be her own worst enemy . 
upper west sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute . 
sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now . . . and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors . 
the film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry . 
a deceivingly simple film , one that grows in power in retrospect . 
with not a lot of help from the screenplay ( proficient , but singularly cursory ) , [testud] acts with the feral intensity of the young bette davis . 
a riveting documentary . 
whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black . 
barely gets off the ground . 
there's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more . 
the result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from spielberg , who has never made anything that wasn't at least watchable . but it's also disappointing to a certain degree . 
 . . . spellbinding fun and deliciously exploitative . 
the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad . 
filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life . 
some episodes work , some don't . 
even if the naipaul original remains the real masterpiece , the movie possesses its own languorous charm . 
aside from being the funniest movie of the year , simone , andrew niccol's brilliant anti-hollywood satire , has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it . 
the pinochet case is a searing album of remembrance from those who , having survived , suffered most . 
it's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick . 
in moonlight mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle . 
it's not like having a real film of nijinsky , but at least it's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered . 
a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 
 . . . flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and a wide supply of effective sight gags . 
rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects . 
yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it's also a failure of storytelling . 
one of the funniest motion pictures of the year , but . . . also one of the most curiously depressing . 
 . . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes . 
worth a look by those on both sides of the issues , if only for the perspective it offers , one the public rarely sees . 
rifkin's references are . . . impeccable throughout . 
hoffman notches in the nuances of pain , but his smart , edgy voice and waddling profile ( emphasized here ) accent the humor of wilson's plight , and that saves his pathos from drippiness . 
the somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make green dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment . 
john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie . 
this is human comedy at its most amusing , interesting and confirming . 
a special kind of movie , this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of memento . . . 
it's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script . 
suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it's been packaged and sold back to us by hollywood .
