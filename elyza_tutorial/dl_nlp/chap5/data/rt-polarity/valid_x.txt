horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the serbs themselves but also to a network of american right-wing extremists .

 . . . contains very few laughs and even less surprises . 
one can't shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney's latest album .

there's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer . or for the year , for that matter . 
for most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence . 
instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources  good sources , bad mixture
master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours . 
other than the slightly flawed ( and fairly unbelievable ) finale , everything else is top shelf . 
the film is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card . 
it just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) . 
the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous ( but with bears , and a g rating ) , with an excruciating dollop of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure . 
no way i can believe this load of junk . 
a spiffy animated feature about an unruly adolescent boy who is yearning for adventure and a chance to prove his worth . 
schaeffer isn't in this film , which may be why it works as well as it does . 
like its new england characters , most of whom wander about in thick clouds of denial , the movie eventually gets around to its real emotional business , striking deep chords of sadness . 
the filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l . a . to that end , they mock the kind of folks they don't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers don't care to understand , either .

ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff and made a rather sturdy , old-fashioned entertainment out of it . 
one fantastic ( and educational ) documentary . 
pure cinematic intoxication , a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama , tastelessness and swooning elegance . 
efficient , suitably anonymous chiller . 
a cartoon that's truly cinematic in scope , and a story that's compelling and heartfelt -- even if the heart belongs to a big , four-legged herbivore . 
quitting offers piercing domestic drama with spikes of sly humor . 
the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on . 
it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .

the four feathers has rewards , from the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes . 
forgettable , if good-hearted , movie .

the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script . 
it's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , and satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but minority report delivers all that and a whole lot more . 
a well-crafted film that is all the more remarkable because it achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation with restraint and a delicate ambiguity . 
may not be a breakthrough in filmmaking , but it is unwavering and arresting . 
goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab . 
a terrific date movie , whatever your orientation . 
the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life . 
bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that . 
marvelous , merry and , yes , melancholy film .

just how these families interact may surprise you . 
since the movie is based on a nicholas sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things . 
only an epic documentary could get it all down , and spike lee's jim brown : all american at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents . 
as the movie traces mr . brown's athletic exploits , it is impossible not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times . 
attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident . 
the cast . . . keeps this pretty watchable , and casting mick jagger as director of the escort service was inspired . 
wishy-washy . 
i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot . 
essentially " fatal attraction " remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . .

funny and touching . 
a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise . 
a sly female empowerment movie , although not in a way anyone would expect .

fred schepisi's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen . with a cast of a-list brit actors , it is worth searching out . 
involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd .

rates an 'e' for effort -- and a 'b' for boring . 
the artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from japan , the characters move with grace and panache . 
a lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her .

a manically generous christmas vaudeville . 
[kline's] utterly convincing -- and deeply appealing -- as a noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code , and as a flawed human being who can't quite live up to it .

'tobey maguire is a poster boy for the geek generation . '
its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time . 
given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors' workshop that it is . 
does a good job of establishing a time and place , and of telling a fascinating character's story . 
an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it . 
an enigmatic film that's too clever for its own good , it's a conundrum not worth solving .

diane lane shines in unfaithful . almost everything else is wan . 
there's no getting around the fact that this is revenge of the nerds revisited -- again .

the film's sharp , often mischievous sense of humor will catch some off guard . . . 
the most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland . 
the director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in [the characters'] misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it .

worth a salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film . 
distinctly sub-par . . . more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine . 
so riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along . 
even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting . and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea . 
there is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down . and that should tell you everything you need to know about all the queen's men . 
a lovely film . . . elegant , witty and beneath a prim exterior unabashedly romantic . . . hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to its source's complexity . 
if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it's all bluster and clich . 
it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part . 
equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and farenheit 451 . 
the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality . 
this sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem . 
hollywood ending is not show-stoppingly hilarious , but scathingly witty nonetheless . 
you won't look at religious fanatics -- or backyard sheds -- the same way again . 
because eight legged freaks is partly an homage to them , tarantula and other low- budget b-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly ( but not sophomoric ) romp through horror and hellish conditions .

depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it's being . 
what emerges is an unsettling picture of childhood innocence combined with indoctrinated prejudice . promises is a compelling piece that demonstrates just how well children can be trained to live out and carry on their parents' anguish . 
every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point . 
irwin is so earnest that it's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs . there are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy . 
a delightful romantic comedy with plenty of bite . it's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones . 
brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism . 
a big , gorgeous , sprawling swashbuckler that delivers its diversions in grand , uncomplicated fashion .

the movie would seem less of a trifle if ms . sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine .

death might be a release . 
davis has filled out his cast with appealing fresh faces . 
it's a demented kitsch mess ( although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative ) , but it's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year . 
this cheery , down-to-earth film is warm with the cozy feeling of relaxing around old friends . 
it provides a grim , upsetting glimpse at the lives of some of the 1 . 2 million palestinians who live in the crowded cities and refugee camps of gaza . 
visually engrossing , seldom hammy , honorably mexican and burns its kahlories with conviction . 
dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material . 
ratliff's two previous titles , plutonium circus and purgatory county show his penchant for wry , contentious configurations , and this film is part of that delicate canon .

humorous , artsy , and even cute , in an off-kilter , dark , vaguely disturbing way .

if you like quirky , odd movies and/or the ironic , here's a fun one . 
stale and clichd to a fault .

a triumph , a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light . 
[villeneuve] seems to realize intuitively that even morality is reduced to an option by the ultimate mysteries of life and death . 
blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky " pretty woman " retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought . 
with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm . 
another one of those estrogen overdose movies like " divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood , " except that the writing , acting and character development are a lot better . 
the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
frenetic but not really funny .

the weird thing about the santa clause 2 , purportedly a children's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally . 
screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability . 
it's like an all-star salute to disney's cheesy commercialism . 
 . . . spiced with humor ( 'i speak fluent flatula , ' advises denlopp after a rather , er , bubbly exchange with an alien deckhand ) and witty updatings ( silver's parrot has been replaced with morph , a cute alien creature who mimics everyone and everything around ) 
it does give a taste of the burning man ethos , an appealing blend of counter-cultural idealism and hedonistic creativity . 
'no es la mejor cinta de la serie , ni la mejor con brosnan a la cabeza , pero de que entretiene ni duda cabe . '
once again , director chris columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours .

the actresses find their own rhythm and protect each other from the script's bad ideas and awkwardness . 
the story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness . 
there are flaws , but also stretches of impact and moments of awe ; we're wrapped up in the characters , how they make their choices , and why . 
the filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they won't much care about . 
the film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama , but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from paul's perspective . 
the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay . 
the otherwise good-naturedness of mr . deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less- than-likely new york celebrities . . . certainly raises the film above anything sandler's been attached to before . 
all right , so it's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but it is a funny ( sometimes hilarious ) comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast . 
his comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude , calculated to provoke shocked laughter , without following up on a deeper level . 
imperfect ? yes , but also intriguing and honorable , a worthwhile addition to a distinguished film legacy . 
one scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce . 
this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material . 
it tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did . 
denis and co-writer michele petin's impeccable screenplay penetrates with a rawness that that is both unflinching and tantalizing . lead provocatuers testud and parmentier give superlative performances
