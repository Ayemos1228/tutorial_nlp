music sound quality is good as is call quality .

i have even offered clients to take it .
you never fill it more than half full .
i have not had any coraline bloom or growth .
basically you dont get what u paid for .
the spout on the side makes it all possible .
i will not buy necklaces from this vendor again .
charging is no longer than charging my phone alone .

the fibermesh weave on the tip works very well .
in fact this soap doesnt lather well at well .
these slid down my smooth non textured frig .
i got them for my iphone 3gs model .
i have no idea how quinoa should taste .
and no guilt over putting them in dishwasher .
unfortunately , it makes streaks across my laptop screen .
stupid thing shows your pictures on the folder .
even then , very poor performance and artifacts everywhere .
i wish filling it was a little less cumbersome .

specifically , the most likely components to break ie .
not the color that it shows in the picture .
i am talking about 0 tilt and 0 shift .
not your filters or how you brew it .

but this hx550 really reduces the background noise considerably .
it wiggles around and looks bad as well .
the music also fits the mood just right .
these are very nice and worth the money .
i love this machine and recommend it highly .
these hold up great and clip real tight .
and it is the same price as most others .
it keeps everything safely organized and in one place .

i ordered this as a gift for my sister .
this deodorant did not work for me at all .

i ordered two for my grandsons for christmas .
you will not be disappointed if you buy .
similar in price but 100 times the quality .
it nice the be able to charge 2 phones .
i would suggest smaller hands use this phone .

you can use pre-ground beans and eliminate that problem .

it connects easily and was reasonable in price .
the shipper did agree to ship the missing shirt .
okay so i changed my comment on this .
i got this along with the pepper mill .
i declined and decided to live with it .
it 's literally like you rubbed yourself with oil .
overall , good functional product with no real drawbacks .
i bought this one because it has the heater .
i would have wanted more for my money .
easy to clean and comes with a cover .
it may be ok for the right phone .
they will be great for my lake house someday .
worth every penny and more.6-month update : still awesome .
there are only five 1 cup servings per box .
i bought this from the local wal-mart store .
i bought another one for my motorola phone .
be sure to purchase a good bottle stopper too .

basically , this thing has a really weak transmitter .
and i am not a vegetarian or environmental activist .
the actual product is a childhood favorite of mine .
the meat grinder is really handy , and fast .
fit is perfect and very easy to apply .
i prefer one of these over a can opener .

i would not recommend this set for any reason .
not an optimal ingredient , as we are learning .
i bought this knife to cut homemade bread .
this makes the perfect sized cookie for young children .

i think that it is worth that price .
whenever she bakes german cakes here in the u.s .
i tried a frying pan and was not satisfied .
okay i repurchase these every 5 or so years .
this time the pan was not very hot .
i wo n't bother buying this stuff ever again .
seems big but they cooked up just fine .
the coffeemaker still works perfectly and still looks good .
but the dough is just not fun at all .
overall i feel as though this product is weak .
this should be called mush in a can .
it is sort of hard to change the things .
it is well made and not flimsy at all .
the factory shaft is much better than this one .
i like that is is one piece of metal .
what are they thinking treating people like this .
the set arrived quickly and i love it .
it is only me and my oldest son .
targus claims this is a 90w power supply .
no more magician pulling of headphones for me .
the router would get pdat messages and disconnect immediately .
even the mister setting was a little too vigorous .
there are no ingredients listed on the label .

and i still have 99 bags to go .
i then read that the mother was murdered .
i do n't think there was one positive review .

recommended for general use , is holding up well .
just added this size because my wife wanted it .
button response thru the case is very good .
this was a gift and it was greatly appreciated .
this has to be the worst idea ever .
you just have to put some muscle behind it .
but it makes me kind of angry too .
it leaks when you pour water from it .
this kettle makes a mess with every pour .
i will use that with a little elbow grease .
oem customer service worked to make the situation right .
they are just too thin for outside wear .
and the game has quite of a crapy story .
i literally turned my back and it was gone .
it is stainless steel and easy to clean .
it tasted like a cup of watered down kool-aid .
i use a spray olive oil on mine .
then the next bar broke a few days later .
this is really good deal for the price here .
i like a smooth screen protector not rubbery poo .
but on day three it sprung a leak .
i find myself walking right through some objects .
and it comes with one set of hooks .
i did n't have trouble putting this bra on .
i 've never owned one longer than 5 years .
after playing it i was kind of dissapointed .
i use it for large and small areas .
the professional series are durable and dishwasher safe .
a great price and not one complaint at all .
some epoxy will likely fix this but still .
shavings are dusty and cause respiratory issues in ferrets .
good addition to kitchen utensils and well constructed .
it didnt look good on me at all .
my 3 yo son got this for christmas .
great for long trips or a drive across town .
but that turned out to be non issue .
it 's extremely hard to get fingerprints off too .
i heard good good things about otter box cases .
the sound is first class though , when working .
she always gets asked where she got them .
the vpn does not work either with it .
would recommend to anyone thinking of such a purchase .
works very well with softer doughs and other things .
this item was exactly as described and promptly shipped .
i am a huge fan of all htc phones .
the fit was terrible and they looked funny .
one reason is that it stains your colon .
the next day , i tried turning it on .
she suggested at 350 degress for an hour .
i love it.also , the sound quality is unparalleled .
that allows you to easily find a cd .
the wide size is much easier for zesting .
ugh- just not super pleased with this stuff .
this organizer works well for my silverware drawer .
it does n't rock or rattle on the counter .
he is so happy with the new opener .
the medal of honor games have always been great .
my dog had no interest in playing with it .
so would people who have a blackberry style .
no overheating or charging loss faster than the original .

these are easy to store and easy to clean .
let me state i am a superman fan .
it is a great item and a great price .
these shorts did not survive their first washing .
i 'm back on amazon looking for a replacement .
the dvb-200 has a larger capacity than the dvb-140 .
i received it on time and they work great .
somethings you can mix and some you ca n't .
it does n't rust and clean-up is a breeze .
this little machine works really well for all that .
it is a bit clunky..that is the bad news .
the charger is an extension of the phone .
i have to contact palm about the warranty .
it came in a timely fashion.would buy again ! .
four stars.i hope this was helpful to you .
it would be cheaper and would work better .
i used these with a canon s2 is camera .
it is also really hard to take off .
my son used his allowance for this purchase .
stir-fried vegetables are easy to make with this pan .
i wish i had discovered this years ago .
it was used maybe 4 times a year .
i highly recommend this for sealing your weights .
first - good volume - they were loud .
it offers good protection and looks really nice .
so i would have had to pay return shipping .
i wish they made these for my other phones/tablets .
the cats love it , the dog loves it .
i 've placed a new order for the item .
do n't throw away your money like i did .
awaiting word from monster about warranty repair or replacement .
i ca n't go back to hoover or eureka .
but i actually use it for most applications .
this one is for us , good or bad .
i guess i just expected more from it .
now the same thing has happened with my gamecube .
honestly - do not hesitate to purchase this item .
sent it back right after i got it .
2 of these were purchased and one arrived damaged .
a piece of toast with jam is more appealing .
i was pleasantly surprised how well both functioned .
not true ! this made a terrible mushy mess .
however , within a day we had ants everywhere .
also , this game is not enjoyable at all .
the control on the right earbud side works fine .
and doing a few rinse/soak cycles is a pain .
it 's a quality glass pitcher made in italy .
this cookie press would not release the cookies .
i admit i purchased this without reading the reviews .
i am hoping for the same with this one .
it feels less bulky and looks a lot better .
i have a couple and they are very useful .
you might want to look for something else .
product did not work for me at all .
the angled tip makes sliding beneath food easy .
this item arrived promptly and was very well packaged .
those were the two reasons we bought this chalk .
i 've never had any other croc do this .
they are indispensable for the blender i bought .
it 's a good size for turkeys and hams .
being naturally wavy and somewhat difficult to manage .
well the cleaning is not up to industry standard .
yogurt gets more sour the longer it incubates .
my husband is a slave to their clippers .
i hand wash it and i have no complaints .
you need to lean it against the wall .
it has almost a sweet flavor to it .
tight fit and i think it will last .
the ones that came with this shelf are rubbish .
i just keep on ordering the different colors .
when this unit goes off hit the brakes .
i wish there was a charger that actually lasts .
it is grossly inaccurate , off by 20+ degrees .
the product came as described and works great .
i suggest it if you are looking for one .
the magpul case beats this one hands down .
get rid of whatever is causing that soap flavor .
i like the thin profile compared to otterbox .
forced to drop the rating because of durability issues .
i mean nothing about this game make sense .
this will be my last api filstar filter .
i am very pleased with the quality and price .
purchased it through amazon from a 3rd party vendor .
i use this everyday for all my cutting needs .
it is so nice to know i am covered .
it was no bigger than my grocery store masher .
it is a useful item in your kitchen drawer .
i bought both just to verify this point .
the lack of design makes this product worthless .
the seller was very good on taking it back .
this head phones do nothing that their ment for .
he loves the small nylabones and chews them everyday .
the battery last a long time after each charge .
this is our reason for buying a bunn .
can voice command my smartphone from my earpiece .
there are many excellent watch sizing tools out there .
that has not been the case with this pack .
there are over 50,000 apps on the android market .
i have been generally pleased with the blender .
the material is heavy and appears to be durable .
it does n't heat up my counter top either .
i grew up with oneida colonial boston silverware .
it looks more like swimwear than under garment .
this is an excellent grinder for coffee beans .
stick with name brands for quality and function .
it was thick & not flesh friendly at all .
if your not absolutely sure dont buy it .
this case is one of my daughters favorites .
not all of the laws are clearly spelled out .
first , this is not for the heavy use .
i have had no problems with the product .
a cinch to clean and comfortable in the hand .
is a simple charger , nothing special to describe .
it cuts and cores and apple in seconds .
it assembles in minutes just like lego pieces .
highly recommendable and very convenient with the usb port .
i liked this one because of the handle .
i guess i will always wear nylon panties .
this case is really cute and brightly colored .
have to be careful with ordering batteries online .
la tortilla needs to try again on this product .
also the recommended dosage resulted in crazy headache .
personally i love the original frangrace by queen latifah .
so , i ordered this one to replace it .
the buttons are mushy and feel poorly engineered .
it picks up the roar of any background noise .
durable , heavy cored and the finish is attractive .
with winter coming on , these boots are great .
there 's no real learning curve to worry about .
this case fell apart too quickly for me .
maglite used to be the standard for good flashlites .
i love peanuts , and i love peanut butter .
i bought one of these for my car .
i could return and get my money back .
not worth spending the extra and getting it online .
the controls on the headphone is easy to control .
my son normally loves earth 's best jarred foods .
i am going back to a simpler design .
none of them survive being dropped without some problems .
the adjustment screws for the cutting thickness are brass .
it has a chocolate coating on the outside .
i 've had this product for almost a year .
the case holds the knives very securely though .
have to scrub to get the make up off .
so i should n't have this kind of problem .
like i said , it is not really steam .
in my opinion they are a good value .
the next morning the odor was creeping back .
cover would not stay locked or stay in place .
well , the safflower gets jammed in the feeder .
love the look and feel of this scoop .
catching the empty holster on a chair arm .
may try it as shampoo next on my dog .

and i tried to achieve that with this .
and the two towers is just not that fun .
the plastic is more flexible than the old style .

great can opener for easy handling and operation .
this oxo peeler is not like the others .
the thermal pot does work when used correctly .
all 3 of these eventually stopped working properly .

very nice , has been working for 2 years .
which is handy when one has odd hours .
i plan on getting this in other colors .
synthetic vitamins may actually do more harm than good .
they are dark blue denim ; definitely not black .
the product and the seller are highly recommended ! .
i was really excited to get this game .
the item i received is not the item pictured .
i must also compliment the company on its service .
just not the same in terms of the flavour .
in effect making the wrap-around brief much more absorbent .

works great and is still on the phone .
i bought these for work and these were sub-par .
a lot of things simply do n't work right .
must look like a cup coaster or somethin .
this filter turned green within the first week .
it is a simple , but necessary kitchen tool .
they are n't mega chewers but enjoy a treat .
the variety and sizes of the containers are great .
this does not sound like a turkey at all .
it stores upright to save cabinet space as well .
i like it.the monster and player animation is adequate .
the monotony is broken up by rocks though .
it does what it is supposed to do .
i realized that all vines are not created equally .
this sling is just too short to be practical .
the spatula may be a bit too long .
this works great for citrus peels and ginger .
they are high quality and a good size .
silicone inner skin with hard plastic outer shell .
and sooo much bigger than in the picture .
i can fit two toothpastes in the cup part .
i do n't think this will last very long .
heavyweight plastic and last for quite a while .
this lack of control just becomes down-right annoying .
this charge was like 5 or 6 bucks .

i wo n't be ordering more of this variety .
we have had numerous of these over the years .
the play-doh itself ? of course that is great .
does not add any bulk to my phone .
i would n't hang pots and pans off this .
otherwise they are a great tasting protein bar .
i am ashamed that i bought these headphones .

would like to see the company re-design this shoe .
picked this setup for my htc amaze 4g .

the cable unplug and fits right inside for travel .
it was higher as i requested but not soft .
i also love the heft of this pan .
cables work fine , feel like they will last .
this is a substantial and great looking colander .
does exactly what i thought and hoped it would .
does not work has no effect at all .
the lcd digits are large for easy reading .
a must have for any one that cooks .
i got one of these but it was defective .
those are its only functions and it fails miserably .
audio quality is much better than i had expected .
this product increased my wrinkles and burnt my skin .
i can only assume it is a good product .
i am enjoying the panasonic bread maker immensely .
they fit perfect and really protect my phone .
the size is perfect for storing in refrigerator door .
these mice seem to be incompatible with computers now .
the peanut butter flavor is the best by far .
absolutely will not be purchasing this products again .
you put cake mix in it and make cake .
when completed i was left with flat hair .
that 's probably the best part of the game .
they have also held up extremely well : ) .
i bought this on ebay for 159.00 incl .
saves on cleaning and the use of aluminum foil .
this pan is absolutely perfect for baking baguettes .
this set of 3 is perfect for our needs .
but it sure does cause bloating of 10-12 lbs .
all i could see is smudges and fingerprints .
i saw all the great reviews and awards .
just be informed about what you are ingesting .
i like the fact that this product is clear .
i really like this case for the most part .
i would be weary of giving these to children .
kneading my pizza dough is easier now as well .
i love that it came with a car charger .
if you want a tablet , get a tablet .
they must be making a killing selling these batteries .
i have used this off and on since 1982 .
it wont slip off and it stays looking clean .
bought this to replaced a scoop made in 1923 .
you have to make trade offs in areas .
it is well made , esthetically pleasing and functional .
it is quite a bit thicker than the sedio .
it was also the most targeted for malware .
even with light use it is falling apart .
its not to bulky and feels good in hands .
it 's a must have for any serious cook .
i would rather play jeopardy than play this ! .
if anyone knows of one please let me know .
this item did not work for me at all .
